# Threads Clone - MERN and React Native

Welcome to the Threads Clone project! This repository contains a complete guide to building a social media platform similar to Threads using the MERN stack and React Native. We will create a mobile app that works on both Android and iOS devices, and by the end of this project, you will be able to generate an APK of the app to share with your friends.
